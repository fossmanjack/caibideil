			`and of all things visible and invisible.\n\nAnd in one Lord Jesus Christ, `+
			`the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all ages; `+
			`Light of Light, true God of true God, begotten, not created, of one `+
			`essence with the Father, through Whom all things were made, who for `+
			`us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate `+
			`of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became man.  He was `+
			`crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried; `+
			`and He rose on the third day according to the Scriptures.  He `+
			`ascended into Heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father, `+
			`and He will come again with glory to judge the living and the dead. `+
			`His kingdom shall have no end.\n\nAnd in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, `+
			`Creator of life, Who proceeds from the Father, Who, together with `+
			`the Father and the Son, is worshipped and glorified, Who spoke `+
			`through the prophets.\n\nI believe in one holy, catholic, and `+
			`apostolic Church.\n\nI confess one baptism for the forgiveness `+
			`of sins.\n\nI look for the resurrection of the dead and the life `+
			`of the age to come.\n\nBiodh se.`,
