### Recurring Sunrise/Sunset

If we're using Notifee I think we just have to create individual alarms for each day's sunrise and sunset.
I think I'm going to disable the per-day options -- they're all daily reminders.  It wouldn't be too bad
to create seven individual alarms that would then recur ... oh, wait, the sunrise/sunset might be good
candidates for event triggers maybe.

Remember we have to work out how to run these things on the hourly.  Power management, I mean.  Have to
make sure the app isn't killed in the background.

Anyway I have three reminders set right now, each scheduled to go off in an hour or so.
